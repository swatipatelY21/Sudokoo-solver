# Sudoko-solver
suduko using backtracking in c++

    1.Developed a Sudoku solver program in C++ using backtracking algorithm to find a solution for a given Sudoku puzzle.
    
    2.Implemented functions to check the feasibility of placing a number in a specific cell based on Sudoku rules.
    
    3.Utilized a recursive approach to search for the solution and backtrack if an invalid assignment is encountered.
    
    4.Created functions to find unassigned locations in the Sudoku grid and check for the usage of numbers in rows, columns, and        3x3 subgrids.
    
    5.Designed the program to print the solved Sudoku grid if a solution exists; otherwise, it indicates that no solution exists.
    
    6.Demonstrated problem-solving skills through the application of algorithmic techniques to tackle a complex puzzle-solving          scenario.
    
    7.Gained experience in array manipulation, logical reasoning, and algorithm optimization.
    
    8.Developed proficiency in debugging and testing strategies to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the Sudoku solver.
    9.Applied principles of modular programming for code readability and maintainability.
    
    10.Successfully completed and showcased the project as a practical demonstration of algorithmic problem-solving in a                 programming environment.
    
    11.Enhanced skills in C++ programming, problem analysis, and algorithm design.
